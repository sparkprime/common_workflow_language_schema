doc(|||
  A workflow is a process consisting of one or more `steps`. Each
  step has input and output parameters defined by the `inputs` and `outputs`
  fields. A workflow executes as described in [execution model]
  (#workflow_graph).

  # Dependencies #

  Dependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source` field on
  [workflow step input parameters](#workflowstepinput) and [workflow output
  parameters](#workflowoutputparameter).

  The `source` field expresses the dependency of one parameter on another
  such that when a value is associated with the parameter specified by
  `source`, that value is propagated to the destination parameter. When all
  data links inbound to a given step are fufilled, the step is ready to
  execute.

  # Extensions #

  [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#scatterfeaturerequirement) and
  [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#subworkflowfeaturerequirement) are
  available as standard extensions to core workflow semantics.

      execute steps concurrently, provided that dependencies between steps
