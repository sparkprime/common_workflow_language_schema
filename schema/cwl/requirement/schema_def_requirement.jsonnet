  This field consists of an array of type definitions which must be used when
  interpreting the `inputs` and `outputs` fields.  When a symbolic type is
  encountered that is not in [`Datatype`](#datatype), the implementation must
  check if the type is defined in `schemaDefs` and use that definition.If the
  type is not found in `schemaDefs`, it is an error.  The entries in
  `schemaDefs` must be processed in the order listed such that later schema
  definitions may refer to earlier schema definitions.
