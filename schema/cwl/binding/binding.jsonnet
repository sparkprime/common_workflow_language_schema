      input or output File parameter to which this binding applies.

      If the value is a string, it specifies that the following pattern
      should be applied to the primary file:
        1. If string begins with one or more caret `^` characters, for each
          caret, remove the last file extension from the path (the last
          period `.` and all following characters).  If there are no file
          extensions, the path is unchanged.
        2. Append the remainder of the string to the end of the file path.
